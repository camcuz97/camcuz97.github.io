	<h2>About Me</h2>

	<p> Hi, my name is Cameron Cuzmanko! I'm a Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I'm originally from Libertyville,
		IL, a northern suburb of Chicago. In high school, I participated in Robotics, Model UN, Tennis, Cross-Country and Track. Outside of school,
		I volunteered with the Special Recreation Association of Central Lake County (SRACLC). I first started seriously programming in my senior year
		of high school. I've since made one web app. I have learned java and some python, html, css, and javascript. Hopefully, my coding library will continue
		to expand for years to come.
	</p>

	<p>During my time at UIUC, I hope to get involved in ACM, SHPE and one other RSO that I have yet to decide on.</p>

	<p>	Take a second to look at my <a href="assets/CameronResume.pdf">resume</a>!</p>
